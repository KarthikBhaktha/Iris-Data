# Iris-Data-SKlearn

This notebook explains how Machine Learning can be applied to predict the species of Iris.
This is a very famous dataset in the world of machine learning and a base for new ML enthusiasts to start off with. We will be using the scikit-learn library, use KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbor) class and Logistic Regression class from the library to perform ML over the Iris dataset

Purpose:
to explain how the algorithm functions and predicts the species of Iris.
to explain the steps involved in the process.
how to successfullly train and test the dataset.


Terminologies to keep in mind:
Rows: Observations, sample, example, instance and records
Columns: Features, , Predictors, attributes, indespendent variable, covariate, iput regressor.
Target: Response, outcome, label, dependent variable.
